# Fintech_Finder
##Challenge 19

##Technologies
This application is written using Python 3.9.7 with the Streamlit library to create a shareable webpage interface for finding a fintech professional and pay them for their work using a digital wallet and the personal Ethereum blockchain Ganache.  A mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache is used to generate a new Ethereum account instance. A Fintech Finder candidate is selected as user input from a dropdown menu and the total value of the Ethereum transaction is calculated and compared to the account balance. The transaction to pay the candidate is digitally signed and executed by sending to the Ganache blockchain.  The transaction hash code is returned and inspected in Ganache
